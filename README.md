Hospital Length of Stay Dataset Project focuses on analyzing hospital patient data and predicting the number of days a patient stays in the hospital. The project follows a complete data science pipeline including data loading, descriptive statistics, exploratory data analysis, data quality checks, and Linear Regression modeling. 
# Hospital Length of Stay Dataset – Data Science Project

## Project Overview
This project applies data analysis and machine learning techniques to analyze hospital data and predict the **length of stay** of patients using a **Linear Regression model**.

## Dataset
- **Name:** Hospital Length of Stay Dataset  
- **File:** LengthOfStay.csv  
- **Source:** Kaggle  
- **Target Variable:** lengthofstay (number of days a patient stays in the hospital)

## Project Structure
- `data/raw/` – Original dataset (LengthOfStay.csv)
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks for analysis
  - `01_data_loading_and_understanding.ipynb`
  - `02_data_cleaning_and_eda.ipynb`
  - `03_modeling_linear_regression.ipynb`
- `report/` – Final PDF report
- `README.md` – Project description

## Methodology
1. Data loading and understanding
2. Descriptive statistics and exploratory data analysis (EDA)
3. Data quality checks (missing values and duplicates)
4. Investigation of categorical variables
5. Linear Regression modeling
6. Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R²

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Results
The Linear Regression model provides a baseline prediction for hospital length of stay and demonstrates how patient-related variables can be used to support hospital resource planning.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates a complete data science pipeline from data exploration to predictive modeling and reporting.
